                    <p class="about-text">In a world shaped by code, I believe knowledge is power—but sharing that knowledge is what creates impact. I’m a Computer Science undergrad from Vasavi College, driven by a deep passion for demystifying complex tech concepts. From configuring networks in Cisco environments to building emotion-aware ML systems and full-stack applications, I enjoy bridging the gap between theory and practice. But beyond building, I find joy in teaching—breaking down abstract CS topics into digestible, exciting lessons. I don’t just want to innovate—I want to empower others to do the same.</p>
                    <p class="about-text">My journey in tech has been anything but one-dimensional. I thrive across domains—network security, MERN stack development, and speech-based NLP—each project teaching me not just skills, but systems thinking. Whether it's deploying secure networks or designing gamified learning apps, I aim to build things that are both meaningful and maintainable. What sets me apart is not just technical agility, but the hunger to share. Teaching CS is more than a backup plan—it's a mission I carry forward, blending clarity, creativity, and curiosity into every interaction.</p>
                    <p class="about-text">Every line of code I write tells a story—of curiosity, challenges, and constant growth. I’m Ammar, a full-stack developer, CCNA-certified network enthusiast, and an NLP explorer. But above all, I’m a student of learning—both mine and others’. My proudest moments aren’t just the systems I’ve built, but the moments I’ve helped someone understand recursion, networks, or machine learning for the first time. Tech is my toolkit, but teaching is my superpower. I aspire to build a career where knowledge isn't hoarded—it's multiplied.</p>
